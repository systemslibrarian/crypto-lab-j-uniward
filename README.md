## What It Is

*An interactive research lab that teaches why adaptive steganography works.*

Browser-native implementation of **J-UNIWARD** (JPEG Universal Wavelet Relative Distortion) — the academic reference for adaptive JPEG steganography. Implements the full pipeline from the 2013 Holub & Fridrich paper:

- **Cost function:** Daubechies-8 three-level wavelet decomposition assigns a distortion cost to each DCT coefficient — changes in textured regions are "cheaper." Computed in well under a second via precomputed per-mode wavelet footprints (a ~1000× speedup over the literal definition, validated against it in the test suite).
- **Embedding:** Full Syndrome-Trellis Code (STC, h=12, 4096 states) finds the minimum-distortion modification via Viterbi search (Filler, Judas & Fridrich 2011). The payload is spread across the whole image by a keyed permutation over the full coefficient pool, so changes land in the globally cheapest — most textured — coefficients.
- **Key schedule:** PBKDF2-SHA-256 (600k iterations) → HKDF domain separation → AES-CTR hat matrix + Fisher-Yates permutation. HMAC-SHA-256 integrity tag; a real embed→download→upload→extract round-trip recovers the message and verifies the tag.
- **Steganalysis:** Honest three-way comparison (LSB vs F5 vs J-UNIWARD) at the same payload. LSB's spatial edits are re-projected into the quantized DCT domain via a real forward DCT, then every method's changes are ranked against the cost map by *where they land* — the distortion that actually predicts detectability — plus a DCT histogram view (with the cover distribution overlaid so the F5 shrinkage tell is visible).

Everything runs locally in your browser. No backends, no simulated math, no rigged comparison: at the recommended payloads J-UNIWARD genuinely wins, and the panel shows it honestly.

### Teaching scaffolding (progressive disclosure)

Built for both a newcomer meeting adaptive steganography for the first time and a cryptographer after the subtle details:

1. **Plain-English glossary layer** — load-bearing jargon (`bpnzac`, `DCT`, `wavelet`, `AC`/`DC`, `STC`/`Viterbi`, `shrinkage`) is gated behind a one-line hover/focus gloss wherever it first appears, so the raw acronym never lands cold.
2. **"Inside the cost" block probe** — click any 8×8 block on the cover image to nudge it by a +1 DCT step and watch the ripple hit all nine wavelet detail subbands, with the *cover-magnitude denominator* shown next to each — so you *see* why busy texture yields low normalized cost. Computed live from the same Daubechies-8 transform the embedder uses; no faked numbers.
3. **F5 shrinkage annotation** — the DCT histogram overlays the cover distribution and rings/arrows the suppressed ±1 buckets, pointing directly at the tell the demo names.
4. **STC / Viterbi schematic** — a stepped walkthrough of the keyed permutation spreading the payload, then the trellis choosing the globally cheapest minimum-distortion flip-set over the cost map.
5. **Placement-proxy framing** — the change-exposure bars are labelled *placement proxy — not a detector* at the point of use, each paired with a one-line "what a real detector would see" note, so a low bar is never misread as "provably safe."

## When to Use It

- Teaching *why* adaptive steganography resists detection better than naive LSB or F5 embedding.
- Walking through the J-UNIWARD pipeline end to end — wavelet cost map, STC embedding, keyed spreading, and round-trip extraction.
- Comparing steganographic methods at equal payload to see *where* each one's changes land relative to image texture.
- Do NOT use it to hide data in adversarial settings — it is a teaching and portfolio demo, not an undetectable channel.

## Live Demo

**[systemslibrarian.github.io/crypto-lab-j-uniward](https://systemslibrarian.github.io/crypto-lab-j-uniward/)**

Load a sample image or your own JPEG, enter a secret message and shared key, and embed with J-UNIWARD while a live panel compares LSB, F5, and J-UNIWARD at the same payload — showing where each method's changes land on the wavelet cost terrain, change-exposure bars, DCT histograms, and detectability labels. A 10× amplified difference map visualizes the edits, an image-suitability indicator flags poor carriers, and a full embed → download → upload → extract round-trip recovers the message and checks its integrity tag.

## What Can Go Wrong

- **Placement is a proxy, not a detector.** The analysis measures *where* changes land relative to texture — the quantity J-UNIWARD minimizes — which predicts resistance better than any single first-order test. It is not itself a steganalyzer; real-world detection (SRM, SRNet, XuNet) uses deep learning on rich feature sets.
- **High payloads expose everyone.** Above ~0.3 bpnzac even adaptive embedding runs out of textured coefficients, and F5's non-zero-AC bias can match J-UNIWARD's placement. The default/recommended rates (≤ 0.2) are where adaptive placement clearly wins.
- **COM marker sideband.** Salt, rate, and payload length are stored in a JPEG COM marker for extraction. This metadata may be stripped by image pipelines or social media compression.
- **Not "undetectable."** J-UNIWARD is *more resistant* than LSB/F5 — not invisible to all attacks.
- **Educational tool.** This is a teaching and portfolio demo, not suitable for adversarial environments.

## Real-World Usage

- J-UNIWARD is a standard academic benchmark for adaptive JPEG steganography, introduced by Holub & Fridrich (2013) and widely used to evaluate embedding and detection methods.
- Syndrome-Trellis Codes (STC), the minimal-distortion coding layer used here, are the reference embedding technique across modern steganography research.
- Modern steganalysis — rich-model features (SRM) and deep-learning detectors such as SRNet and XuNet — is developed and benchmarked against schemes like J-UNIWARD.
- The wavelet-distortion idea generalizes to the broader UNIWARD family (S-UNIWARD for spatial, SI-UNIWARD for side-informed embedding) used across image formats.

```bash
npm test         # core correctness suite (DCT roundtrip, embed↔extract, analysis)
npm run build    # typecheck + production build
```

`npm test` exercises the real pipeline end-to-end — decode → cost map → embed → JPEG encode → re-decode → extract — plus the forward/inverse DCT and the steganalysis ordering. Run `SLOW=1 npm test` to additionally validate the fast cost map against the reference implementation.
